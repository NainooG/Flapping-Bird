## Flappy Bird Clone 

Made from absolute scratch using Arcade, a Python game development library

A very bare bone version of Flappy Bird, includes: 
- A physics engine, so collision with the pipes and ground is possible
- A score that doesn't tick (yet)
- User input that allows you to spam jump (and exit the map, if you so please)
- Original sprites from the Flappy Bird game
